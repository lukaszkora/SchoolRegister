# SchoolRegister
This is a "School Register" app - my academic project completed in 2013 while studying at Warsaw School of Computer Science (Warszawska Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki).

It allows (depending on user role) to add/edit/delete data ref. students, grades and news (visible on landing page).
Also, there is a simple "statistics" module which allows to find out about total average grade for all students, or certain class, or student, or course.

You're welcome to check how it works:
